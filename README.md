# Weather_App
# This is a simple weather made to check the current weather,
# check a 7 hour forecast, as well as a 3 day weather forecast.

# I used the Weather API from WeatherAPI.com to get the necessary
# weather data for this program. I used the site's free api plan,
# so I was limited to what data I could use in my application
# (i.e. Could not provide a 7 day weather forecast since that data
# was included under a paid plan)

# Finally, CustomTkinter was used to create the GUI. 

# My goal for this project was to simply familiarize myself 
# working with APIs, as well as learn Tkinter to build a GUI
# in python.
